Project Name: YouTube Comments Section UI
Made With: Figma
Designed For: iPhone (iOS)

Explanation:
This is a mobile UI design for a YouTube video page, mainly showing how the comments section could look. I created it to explore a clean and easy-to-use layout for users who watch videos and read or leave comments on their phones.
